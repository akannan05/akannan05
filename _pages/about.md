I am Anirudh, and welcome to my website! :metal:

I'm a first year student at the University of California, Los Angeles. My current interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision and Robotics. I want to employ robotics to solve real-world challenges in a variety of fields by enhancing their perception and decision making capabilities. Recently, I have also been learning about Reinforcement Learning (MARL in particular) and I hope to apply it to some area of controls theory in the future.

On this website, you can find my up to date CV, GitHub repositories, projects, and any past, present, and future courses I take. 

I'm currently planning a project for the summer in which I will be building a ground robot using Arduino and Rasberry Pi, with the end goal being autonomous control through a web application as well as face detection. I plan on updating this website occasionally with my progress along with pictures of the development.

When I'm not in classes or working, I like to wind down by playing/watching basketball, going on hiking and backpacking trips, and working out.
